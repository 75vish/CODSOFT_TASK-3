Hello everyone,



This is the third task in the Codsoft Internship in the Data Science field. This project is for the predition of the species of Iris flower and the datset for it has been provided in the repository.



The dataset includes the columns as follows- sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width and	species which have been used to predict the species in the project.



This project uses Random Forest Classifier as well as the data science steps such as analysis, preprocessing, visualization, modeling and analysis to predict the values.



Result- The model has an accuracy score of 0.9210526315789473



Conclusion- This project usesss the various varaibles and information provided by the dataset to predict the species of the Iris flower.
